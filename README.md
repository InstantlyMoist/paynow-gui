## How to install
1. Compile the latest version of the plugin (Download coming soon)
2. Place the jar in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart the server
4. Configure the plugin by editing the `config.yml` generated by it. Most notably the `store_identifier` which ensures the plugin loads in your store.
5. Restart the server again, this will generate the required files.

You're free to edit the `config.yml` and `products.yml` to your liking. 
The `products.yml` is a file containing all products, allowing you to edit what they look like within the GUI.
